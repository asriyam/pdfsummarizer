Bacteria in the digestive system break down nutrients, including complex sugars, into forms the body can use. Non-hazardous bacteria additionally help prevent diseases by occupying places that the pathogenic, or disease-causing, bacteria want to attach to. Some bacteria shield us from disease by attacking pathogens.\"",
